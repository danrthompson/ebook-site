					Crowdfunding - the collective effort across a group to make a particular idea a reality - is taking the world by storm. In 2011, entrepreneurs raised over $1.5 Billion to make their ideas a reality. This year, that number is expected to grow to $5.1 Billion.

					It's too early to tell if crowdfunding  will be the way of the future, or if it will evolve into something completely different. But for now, one thing is certain. If you’re trying to realize a dream or see an idea become a reality, it’s probably the best tool at your disposal.

						 <p>On May 18, 2012 Eric Migicovsky became a millionaire. When his Kickstarter campaign came to an end, he and his team had raised over 10 million dollars from almost 70,000 backers and moved towards production without taking a cent of venture capital. The Pebble Watch - Migicovsky's campaign - demonstrates what is possible when people converge to make good ideas happen. With the help of the crowd, everyday individuals can bring their ideas to life.</p>
												<br>

						 <p>And they are. On Kickstarter alone, almost a half a billion dollars have been pledged towards 85,000 projects. In 2013 crowdfunding is expected to grow to a $5.1 Billion industry, almost doubling over the course of a year. What's more, this growth is being spearheaded by parents and students, designers and artists, and everyday people inspired by good ideas.</p>
