					<p id="larger_p_text">Never before has it been so easy to raise so much money, involve so many people, and <span class="teal para-bold"> bring your idea to life.</span></p>
					<br>					
					<p>
					Crowdfunding - the collective effort across a group to make a particular idea a reality - is taking the world by storm. In 2011, entrepreneurs raised over <span class="teal para-bold"> $1.5 Billion </span>to make their ideas a reality. This year, that number is expected to <span class="teal para-bold"> grow to $5.1 Billion.</span>

					<p>
					It's too early to tell if crowdfunding  will be the way of the future, or if it will evolve into something completely different. But for now, one thing is certain.<span class="teal para-bold">  If youâ€™re trying to realize a dream</span> or see an idea become a reality, it is <span class="teal para-bold">a powerful tool at your disposal.</span>

						 <p><span class="orange para-bold"> On May 18, 2012 Eric Migicovsky became a millionaire.</span> When his Kickstarter campaign came to an end, he and his team had raised over 10 million dollars from almost 70,000 backers and moved towards production without taking a cent of venture capital (or giving away a share in his company). The Pebble Watch - Migicovsky's campaign - demonstrates what is possible when people converge to make good ideas happen. With the help of the crowd, <span class="orange para-bold">everyday individuals can bring their ideas to life.</span></p>
												<br>

						 <p>And they are. On Kickstarter alone, more than half a billion dollars have been pledged towards <span class="orange para-bold">85,000 projects</span>. In 2013 crowdfunding is expected to grow to a $5.1 Billion industry, almost doubling over the course of a year. What's more, this growth is being spearheaded by <span class="orange para-bold">parents and students, designers and artists</span>, and everyday people inspired by good ideas.</p>

					<h4 id="thin_title"> A Movement</h4>
					<h4><span class="teal">For Everyone</span></h4>
					<br>			
					<p>
					In 2011, one million crowdfunding campaigns were funded. From third world entrepreneurs, to american artists, sites like Kiva, Indiegogo, and Kickstarter have made it possible for anyone with a good idea to realize their dreams.
					</p><br>

					<p>This is what makes crowdfunding so unique. It is a people's movement. It exists to help anyone realize their ideas - even you. Here are some examples of ordinary people doing extraordinary things with crowdfunding. </p>

								<p>After a heartbreaking YouTube video was posted showing schoolbus monitor Karen Kelein being bullied, Max Sidorov created an Indiegogo campaign to send Karen on the vacation she could never afford. One month later, thousands came together to speak out against bullying and raised over $700,000 for Karen.
